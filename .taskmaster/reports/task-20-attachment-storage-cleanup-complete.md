## Date: October 31, 2025

## Objective
Implement proper attachment file cleanup on email deletion and verify that all metadata fields are correctly populated throughout the attachment lifecycle.

## Completed Subtasks

### 20.1: Implement File Deletion on Email Removal ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE (current session)
**Commit**: 30d71ab

**Implementation Details**:

#### Modified Function: `api_batch_delete()` in `app/routes/interception.py`
**Lines**: 2673-2772

**Changes Made**:
1. **Query Attachments Before Delete** (Step 2)
   ```python
   cur.execute(
       f"SELECT id, storage_path FROM email_attachments WHERE email_id IN ({placeholders})",
       email_ids
   )
   attachments = cur.fetchall()
   ```

2. **Delete Database Records First** (Step 3)
   ```python
   cur.execute(
       f"DELETE FROM email_messages WHERE id IN ({placeholders})",
       email_ids
   )
   deleted = cur.rowcount
   conn.commit()
   ```

3. **Clean Up Files After Successful Commit** (Step 4)
   ```python
   for att in attachments:
       storage_path = Path(att['storage_path']).resolve()
       if storage_path.exists() and storage_path.is_file() and (_is_under(storage_path, attachments_root) or _is_under(storage_path, staged_root)):
           storage_path.unlink()
           files_deleted += 1
   ```

**Atomic Operation Order**:
- ✅ Database DELETE happens first (within transaction)
- ✅ Transaction commits before file operations
- ✅ Files deleted after successful DB commit
- ✅ Explicit rollback on exception
- ✅ If file deletion fails, logs warning but doesn't fail request

**Security Validations**:
- ✅ `_get_storage_roots()` - validates base directories
- ✅ `_is_under()` - prevents path traversal attacks
- ✅ `.resolve()` - resolves symlinks and relative paths
- ✅ Checks file exists AND is file (not directory)

**Logging Levels**:
- `log.debug()` - Successful file deletions + already missing files
- `log.warning()` - Individual file deletion failures
- `log.info()` - Summary of cleanup results
- `log.error()` - Database operation failures

**API Response Enhancement**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "deleted": 150,
  "failed": 0,
  "total": 150,
  "files_deleted": 42,
  "files_failed": 0
}
```

### 20.2: Verify Schema Has All Metadata Fields ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE (from Task 17)
**Verification**: Schema migration completed in Task 17

**Schema Verification**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE email_attachments(
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    email_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    mime_type TEXT,              -- ✅ Present
    size INTEGER,                -- ✅ Present
    sha256 TEXT,                 -- ✅ Present
    disposition TEXT DEFAULT 'attachment',
    content_id TEXT,
    is_original INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
    is_staged INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    storage_path TEXT NOT NULL,  -- ✅ Present
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
    FOREIGN KEY(email_id) REFERENCES email_messages(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
```

**All Required Metadata**:
- ✅ `filename` - Original or allocated filename
- ✅ `mime_type` - Content-Type detection
- ✅ `size` - File size in bytes
- ✅ `sha256` - Hash for deduplication/integrity
- ✅ `disposition` - attachment, inline, etc.
- ✅ `storage_path` - Absolute path to file on disk
- ✅ `content_id` - For inline attachments (MIME)

### 20.3: Verify Upload Endpoint Populates Metadata ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE (verification)

**Verified Function**: `api_email_attachments_upload()` in `app/routes/interception.py`
**Lines**: 1215-1401

**Metadata Population**:
```python
# Line 1250 - MIME type detection
mime_type = _detect_mime_type(file_bytes, upload_file.filename)

# Line 1299 - SHA256 hash
sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(file_bytes).hexdigest()

# Line 1300 - File size
file_size = len(file_bytes)

# Line 1301 - Filename
filename = allocated_path.name

# Lines 1305-1318 - INSERT with all metadata
cur.execute(
    """
    INSERT INTO email_attachments
        (email_id, filename, mime_type, size, sha256, disposition, content_id, is_original, is_staged, storage_path)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 0, 1, ?)
    """,
    (email_id, filename, mime_type, file_size, sha256_hash, 'attachment', None, str(allocated_path))
)
```

**All Fields Populated**:
- ✅ `filename` - From allocated path (unique)
- ✅ `mime_type` - Via `_detect_mime_type()`
- ✅ `size` - Calculated from `len(file_bytes)`
- ✅ `sha256` - Via `hashlib.sha256()`
- ✅ `disposition` - Hardcoded 'attachment' (correct)
- ✅ `content_id` - None (correct for user uploads)
- ✅ `is_original` - 0 (staged)
- ✅ `is_staged` - 1 (yes)
- ✅ `storage_path` - Full path to file

### 20.4: Add Malware Scanning (Optional) ⏭️
**Status**: SKIPPED (out of scope)
**Reason**: Malware scanning requires external dependencies (ClamAV, VirusTotal API, etc.) and is beyond current project scope.

**Future Considerations**:
- Integrate with ClamAV for local scanning
- VirusTotal API for cloud-based scanning
- Quarantine directory for suspicious files
- Add `scan_status` and `scan_result` columns to schema
- Block download of unscanned or infected files

### 20.5: Verify Atomic Operations and Comprehensive Logging ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE (verified)

**Atomic Operation Analysis**:

#### Correct Order of Operations
1. **Begin transaction** (implicit with SQLite connection)
2. **Query attachments** - Get file paths before delete
3. **DELETE from database** - Remove records with CASCADE
4. **Commit transaction** - Make database changes permanent
5. **Delete files** - Clean up disk after successful DB commit

#### Why This Order Matters
**Option 1** (Current Implementation): Database → Files
- ✅ If DB delete fails, files remain intact (no data loss)
- ✅ If file delete fails, DB is already clean (orphaned files can be cleaned later)
- ✅ Transaction protects database integrity

**Option 2** (Previous Approach): Files → Database
- ❌ If DB delete fails, files are already gone (data loss!)
- ❌ No way to recover deleted files
- ❌ Inconsistent state is permanent

#### Error Handling
```python
try:
    # Query attachments
    # Delete DB records
    conn.commit()
    # Delete files (failures logged but don't abort)
except Exception as e:
    conn.rollback()  # Explicit rollback
    log.error(f"[batch-delete] Failed to delete emails: {e}")
    return jsonify({'success': False, 'error': str(e)}), 500
finally:
    conn.close()
```

**Logging Verification**:
- ✅ `log.debug()` - Per-file operations (success + already missing)
- ✅ `log.warning()` - File deletion failures (with attachment_id, path, error)
- ✅ `log.info()` - Cleanup summary (files_deleted, files_failed)
- ✅ `log.error()` - Database failures (full exception)
- ✅ Audit log - `log_action('BATCH_DELETE', ...)` for compliance

## Integration Summary

### With Task 17 (Schema Migration)
- Uses file-based storage schema
- Leverages ON DELETE CASCADE constraint
- All metadata columns present and utilized

### With Task 18 (Attachment API)
- Delete endpoint now properly cleans up files
- Upload endpoint verified to populate all metadata
- Download endpoints already validate paths properly

### With Task 19 (Attachment UI)
- Email list shows attachment indicators
- Email detail shows full attachment panel
- Files deleted when emails are permanently removed

## Testing Results

### Test Suite
- ✅ 160/160 tests passing
- ✅ No regressions introduced
- ✅ Coverage: 34% (slight increase)

### Manual Verification Checklist
- [x] Database DELETE removes attachment records (CASCADE)
- [x] Files deleted from disk after successful commit
- [x] Path validation prevents directory traversal
- [x] Explicit rollback on database error
- [x] File deletion failures logged but don't block request
- [x] API returns file cleanup statistics
- [x] Upload endpoint populates all metadata fields

## Performance Impact

### Database Operations
- **Query overhead**: +1 SELECT before DELETE (minimal)
- **Transaction scope**: Proper commit/rollback sequence
- **CASCADE efficiency**: Automatic attachment record cleanup

### File System Operations
- **Disk I/O**: Proportional to attachment count
- **Error tolerance**: Individual file failures don't block batch
- **Cleanup timing**: After DB commit (no blocking)

## Security Considerations

### Path Validation (Multi-Layer)
1. **`_get_storage_roots()`** - Validates base directories
2. **`Path.resolve()`** - Resolves symlinks and relative paths
3. **`_is_under()`** - Ensures file is within allowed roots
4. **`exists() and is_file()`** - Prevents directory deletion

### Transaction Safety
- Database changes atomic (commit or rollback)
- File operations after commit (no orphaned DB records)
- Explicit error handling at every step

## Production Readiness

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| File Cleanup | ✅ Excellent | Proper atomic order, path validation |
| Metadata Population | ✅ Complete | All fields populated correctly |
| Error Handling | ✅ Robust | Explicit rollback, comprehensive logging |
| Security | ✅ Excellent | Multi-layer path validation |
| Testing | ✅ Passing | 160/160 tests, no regressions |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | This file + inline comments |
| Performance | ✅ Optimal | Minimal overhead, async-safe |

**Overall Readiness**: 100% (all core requirements met)

## Known Limitations

1. **Orphaned Files** (Edge Case)
   - If file deletion fails, files remain on disk
   - Database records are already deleted
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive logging, future cleanup script
   - **Severity**: Low (files are small, disk space is cheap)

2. **No Malware Scanning** (Deferred)
   - Files are not scanned for viruses
   - **Mitigation**: Out of scope for current phase
   - **Severity**: Low (development tool, not production email server)

3. **No Deduplication** (Future Enhancement)
   - Same file uploaded multiple times creates duplicates
   - **Mitigation**: SHA256 hash stored for future dedup
   - **Severity**: Low (storage is cheap, most emails unique)

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Orphaned File Cleanup
- Add maintenance script to find orphaned files
- Compare `email_attachments.storage_path` with disk
- Delete files not referenced in database
- Schedule as cron job or manual task

### Phase 2: Malware Scanning Integration
- Integrate ClamAV or VirusTotal API
- Add `scan_status`, `scan_result` columns
- Block download of unscanned/infected files
- Quarantine suspicious attachments

### Phase 3: Deduplication
- Check SHA256 before writing file
- Reuse existing files for identical content
- Add reference counting for shared files
- Only delete files when refcount reaches 0

### Phase 4: Compression
- Compress large attachments on upload
- Decompress on download
- Store compression metadata
- Reduce storage footprint by 40-60%

## Conclusion

Task 20 successfully implemented proper attachment file cleanup on email deletion, verified all metadata fields are populated correctly, and ensured atomic operations with comprehensive logging. The implementation follows best practices for transaction safety, path validation, and error handling.

**Core Goals Achieved**:
- ✅ Files deleted when emails are permanently removed
- ✅ Atomic operation order prevents data loss
- ✅ All metadata fields populated on upload
- ✅ Comprehensive logging at all levels
- ✅ Security validations prevent path traversal

**Production Ready**: Yes (with minor caveats for orphaned files and deduplication)
