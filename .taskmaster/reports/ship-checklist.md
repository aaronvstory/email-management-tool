- [ ] **Compose Upload Widget**: Deferred from Task 19.3
  - API exists, UI not integrated
  - Workaround: Upload via email edit page
  - Severity: Low (alternate path available)

### Out of Scope
- [ ] **Malware Scanning**: Optional feature deferred
  - Requires ClamAV or VirusTotal integration
  - Not critical for development tool
- [ ] **Deduplication**: SHA256 stored but not used yet
  - Future enhancement for storage optimization
