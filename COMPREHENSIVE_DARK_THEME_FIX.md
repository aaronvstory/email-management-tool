2. **Test the Application**: Navigate through all pages

   - All text is legible (white on dark)
   - Forms are easy to read and use
   - No more white-on-white issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Why `!important` Flags?

Bootstrap 5.3 has very high CSS specificity. The `!important` flags ensure our dark theme overrides take precedence over Bootstrap's defaults.

### Why Global CSS in base.html?

Since `base.html` is extended by all templates, placing the CSS there ensures consistent dark theme across the entire application without modifying every individual template.

### Why Specific Template Fixes?

Some templates had inline `<style>` blocks that were overriding the global CSS. These needed direct modification.

## üìù Maintenance Notes

### For Future Development:

1. **New Templates**: Always extend `base.html` to inherit dark theme
2. **Inline Styles**: Avoid using white/light backgrounds in template `<style>` blocks
3. **Form Controls**: Use Bootstrap classes - they'll inherit dark theme automatically
4. **Modals**: Use `.modal-dialog` and `.modal-content` classes for proper styling

### CSS Priority Order:

1. Inline styles (highest priority)
2. Template `<style>` blocks
3. Global CSS in `base.html` with `!important`
4. Bootstrap defaults (lowest priority)

## üéØ Result

**Before**: Multiple pages with white backgrounds, illegible text, narrow modals
**After**: Consistent dark theme throughout entire application with proper modal sizing
