• Big Gaps
      - Right now the watcher writes to SQLite and logs locally. We need central monitoring: heartbeat metrics exported to Prometheus, alerting when _record_failure trips the circuit, and a UI
        banner when a watcher is offline.
      - Structured audit logs for release/edit/discard already exist but are buried in SQLite; expose them in the web UI so compliance teams can review actions.
  4. Security & UX
      - MFA/smtp credentials are stored once; there’s no rotation story. Add per-account “test connection” (using test_email_connection) in the UI before watchers start.
      - The release editor lets anyone logged in rewrite messages; we should add change tracking (who edited what) and perhaps role-based access.
  5. Scalability
      - Watchers run in-process threads. Once you add a few dozen accounts, SQLite becomes a bottleneck. Plan a migration to Postgres + Celery/async workers so each account can run in its own
        process with retry/backoff.
      - Quarantine folder logic is very heuristic (INBOX.Quarantine vs INBOX/Quarantine). A provider registry with known folder structures would reduce guesswork.

  Nice-to-haves

  - UI polish: show diff preview, original headers, and attachment metadata directly in the held-message view; currently we display raw JSON with minimal insight.
  - API-first approach: expose REST endpoints for release/edit so third-party tools can integrate; use them in the SPA instead of server-rendered forms.

  In short, interception/release works, but the rest of the product (account management, diagnostics, scaling) needs tests, resilience, and visibility before it’s production-grade.


› re: "Massive unaudited surface: app/routes/accounts.py, emails.py, diagnostics.py, the Sieve/rapid-copy services, and all SQLAlchemy models sit at 0–30 % coverage. Right now the happy-path

  anymore? and sieve was salsso deprecated?!? that needs to be totally removed.. we are imap only?!  sshocked u even brought this up: """    interception flow is solid, but anything involving

        - Guard config loads (many os.getenv calls default to empty strings, leading to cryptic failures). Provide explicit defaults and a “configuration health” panel so operators know when

        - Add sanity checks for IMAP folders on release: if Quarantine doesn’t exist or permissions are wrong we log a warning, but we should surface that to the user with a retriable status, not

          will slip by.

• Here’s a phased roadmap that keeps risk low, lets us ship value incrementally, and gives us well-defined gates to make sure we’re not breaking anything along the way. Each phase finishes with
  linters/tests passing, UI smoke checks verified, and a short hardening window before moving on.

  ### Phase 0 – Foundation & Cleanup (Week 1)

  Goals: remove dead code, settle configuration defaults, baseline telemetry.

  1. Deprecation sweep
      - Delete Sieve/rapid-copy modules, SQLAlchemy models, unused templates.
      - Purge routes that reference those modules; add 404 handler for legacy URLs.
      - CI check: repository builds/tests without any Sieve or SQLAlchemy imports.
  2. Configuration hardening
      - Central config.py: pull all os.getenv calls into typed settings with defaults (host, port, poll interval, etc.).
      - Add /healthz/config JSON endpoint to report missing/invalid settings (e.g., missing IMAP_HOST, invalid poll interval).
      - Unit tests for config.py conversions and failure modes.
  3. Telemetry baseline
      - Implement /metrics counter for watcher heartbeats, failure counts, and release/discard actions.
      - Add Prometheus middleware to instrumentation; smoke test by running pytest tests/routes/test_interception_additional.py.
      - Update docs with instructions for scraping.

  Exit criteria: pytest tests green, coverage ≥36 %, dead modules removed, config health endpoint returning sane data in dev.

  ### Phase 1 – Watcher Reliability & UX (Weeks 2-3)

  Goals: guard IMAP folder operations, surface operator issues, make UI consistent.

  1. IMAP guardrails
      - Add explicit Quarantine validation: if folder creation/select fails, store a retriable state in DB and show a banner in the web UI; prevent silent drops.
      - _handle_new_messages: record copy/purge errors to worker_heartbeats.last_error.
      - Unit tests in tests/services/test_imap_watcher_unit.py for failure paths.
  2. UI consistency
      - Stand up a shared ui/components.css; refactor dashboard/release views to use consistent card/table styles.
      - Add Cypress (or Playwright) smoke test: log in, view dashboard, open held message, release.
      - Remove duplicated inline styles; lint with stylelint.
  3. Operator visibility
      - Add watcher status panel: call /healthz, show per-account “OK / Needs Attention / Offline”.
      - Alert banner in navbar when any watcher has _should_stop == True or recent errors.
      - Unit test for dashboard API returning status summary.

  Exit criteria: All UI smoke tests passing, watchers expose actionable errors, manual QA: release/edit/discard flows verified.

  ———

  ### Phase 2 – Integration Testing & Accounts Flow (Weeks 4-5)

  Goals: realistic IMAP simulations, account CRUD coverage, verification UX.

  1. IMAP harness
      - Build test fixture using aiosmtpd + GreenMail-style IMAP stub (e.g., twitchio-IMAP or custom Twisted server) so watcher connects end-to-end.
      - Integration tests:
          - send message ➜ intercepted ➜ verify move to Quarantine.
          - multiple messages and UID tracking.
          - release path writes back to server and deletes from quarantine.
      - Run in CI (mark job optional until stable).
  2. Account provisioning tests
      - Add tests/routes/test_accounts_flow.py to cover create/update/delete using encrypted credentials.
      - Use test_email_connection to validate connectivity on “Save”; ensure failure surfaces error banner.
  3. Diagnostics & Stats smoke tests
      - Minimal tests hitting /diagnostics and /stats to confirm endpoints respond.
      - Add docstrings, ensure they fail gracefully when metrics tables empty.

  Exit criteria: IMAP integration job passes locally; pytest tests/routes/test_accounts_flow.py green; docs updated with integration test instructions.

  ### Phase 3 – Observability & Audit UX (Weeks 6-7)

  Goals: central monitoring, audit visibility, rotation and verification.

  1. Monitoring pipeline
      - Wire heartbeat metrics to Prometheus + optional Grafana dashboard.
      - Set up alert hook (e.g., Slack webhook) triggered by _record_failure or should_stop.
      - Document how to run watchers with metrics.
  2. Audit center
      - Create /audit-log page listing release/edit/discard actions (filter by date/user).
      - Add API /api/audit with pagination for integration.
      - Unit tests verifying audit entries written and displayed.
  3. Credential management
      - Add “Test Connection” button on account edit -> runs test_email_connection.
      - Store last successful test timestamp in DB; show warnings when stale (>30 days).
      - Outline rotation strategy in docs (manual for now, but explicit workflow).

  Exit criteria: Grafana dashboard screenshot, audit log UI validated, connection test button works.

  ———

  ### Phase 4 – Scale & Architecture (Weeks 8-10)

  Goals: prepare for multiple accounts, remove single-node bottlenecks, plan for Postgres.

  1. SQLite to Postgres transition plan
      - Introduce SQL migration framework (Alembic or pewee_migrate).
      - Provide abstraction layer so DB path can be sqlite:/// or postgres://.
      - Write migration guide; add CI job running tests against Postgres 14.
  2. Worker orchestration
      - Refactor ImapWatcher entry point to run as Celery/Redis or APScheduler tasks, enabling horizontal scaling.
      - Provide CLI: python -m app.watchers --account=<id>.
  3. CI/CD gating
      - Stage/production environment config templates.
      - Automated regression job running the IMAP integration suite nightly.

  Exit criteria: Tests passing against Postgres, watchers runnable as separate processes, deployment doc updated.

  ———

  ### Phase 5 – Refinement & Backlog

  - Tackle remaining low-coverage modules (app/routes/accounts.py, etc.) with targeted tests.
  - Evaluate moving front-end to a small SPA for better UX consistency.
  - Optional: add role-based access control (admin vs reviewer).

  ———

  ### Process & Safety Nets

  - Branching: feature branches -> PR -> review -> merge to main; keep main green.
  - Automation: run pytest tests --cov=app --cov-report=term + UI smoke tests on each PR.
  - Rollout: deploy to staging after each phase; soak for a day before production.
  - Documentation: update README/Runbook per phase; keep a change log.

  This staged strategy keeps the noisiest risks up front (dead code/config), hardens the watcher, then layers in realistic testing, operator visibility, and finally scalability. Each phase delivers
  tangible benefits while guarding regression through expanded automated tests.
