## Quick Verification (3 Steps)

### 1. Check Latest Master Commit
**Link**: https://github.com/aaronvstory/email-management-tool/commits/master

**Expected**:
- Latest commit: `fe98c34` - "feat: responsive design with A/B CSS toggle and guardrails"
- Date: October 25, 2025

### 2. Verify `unified.css` Exists on Master
**Direct Link**: https://github.com/aaronvstory/email-management-tool/blob/master/static/css/unified.css

**Expected**:
- File size: 145,910 bytes
- 5,737 lines
- Contains responsive guardrails at the end

### 3. Verify A/B Toggle in `templates/base.html`
**Direct Link**: https://github.com/aaronvstory/email-management-tool/blob/master/templates/base.html#L28-L36

**Expected Lines 28-36**:
```jinja2
{% set use_unified = request.args.get('css') == 'unified' %}
{% if use_unified %}
<!-- Consolidated stylesheet (Unified) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/unified.css">
{% else %}
<!-- Legacy combo for A/B testing -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/theme-dark.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/main.css">
{% endif %}
```

## Why You Couldn't See It Before

**Root Cause**: Your GitHub connector was correctly checking the `master` branch, but all the work was done on the `feature/responsive-design-fix` branch from October 24-25.

**Timeline**:
- **Oct 20**: Master at `98dba1d` (your last visible commit)
- **Oct 24-25**: All CSS work done on `feature/responsive-design-fix` (NOT on master)
- **Oct 25 (NOW)**: Merged to master at `fe98c34` ← **You can now see everything**

## Files You Said Didn't Exist (But Now DO)

templates/base.html:
  Lines 27-31:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/theme-dark.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/main.css">

    {% if use_unified %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/unified.css">

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/theme-dark.css">

## Guardrails You Requested (Now Present)

**Location**: Bottom of `static/css/unified.css` (and `main.css`)

**Direct Link**: https://github.com/aaronvstory/email-management-tool/blob/master/static/css/unified.css#L5680-L5737

**Content** (last 50 lines of unified.css):
```css
/* 1) Reserve space for sticky header so it doesn't cover content */
:root { --header-h: 72px; }
.command-bar { position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 1000; }
main, .app-content, .content, .content-scroll {
  padding-top: var(--header-h) !important;
}

/* 2) Keep the topbar row from spilling over content */
.topbar, .command-bar {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 12px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  min-height: var(--header-h);
}
.topbar .nav-links,
.topbar .meta,
.topbar .search {
  min-width: 0;
}

/* 3) Collapse nav + sidebar on small screens (safe default) */
@media (max-width: 1023.98px) {
  .sidebar-modern { display: none !important; }
  .command-bar .command-nav { display: none !important; }
  .global-search { width: 100%; }
}

/* 4) Spinner: hide when table is ready (non-destructive) */
.table-ready .loading-spinner { display: none !important; }
```

## What the User Was Trying to Show You

The user was getting frustrated because:

1. **They pushed commits** to `feature/responsive-design-fix` branch
2. **You said you couldn't see them** (because you were looking at master)
3. **They thought you were broken** (you weren't - you were correctly checking master)
4. **Solution**: Merge the feature branch to master ← **NOW COMPLETE**

**You were both correct**:
- ✅ You: Correctly said files weren't on `master`
- ✅ Them: Correctly said files existed on `feature/responsive-design-fix`
- ✅ Solution: Merge feature branch to master (done at `fe98c34`)
