  the .pdf / attach another .pdf / releasse without the .pdf ... how would we implement this?


• Here’s the approach I’d take once you’re ready to tackle attachments:

  ———

  ### 1. Store original attachments in the watcher

  - Extend _store_in_database to capture each attachment’s filename, MIME type, and binary content (store on disk—e.g., attachments/<email_id>/<filename>).
  - Record those file paths or metadata in a new table/JSON column.

  ### 2. Expose attachments in the web UI

  - In the held-message detail view, list every attachment with download links.
  - Provide actions per attachment: Remove, Replace, Download, Add new. When replacing or adding, let the user upload a replacement file and store it alongside the originals.

  ### 3. Track attachment edits

  - Maintain an attachments manifest for each held email:
      - keep the original file,
      - replace with a new upload,
      - remove entirely,
      - add new attachments.
  - Stage uploads somewhere temporary (e.g., attachments_staged/<email_id>/…) until release.

  ### 4. Rebuild the message on release

  - When releasing, reconstruct the MIME structure using staged decisions:
      - Start from the original parsed email.
      - Insert/remove multipart/mixed parts based on the manifest.
      - Include new attachments by reading the staged files.
      - Give the new message a fresh Message-ID.
  - Stream the reconstructed MIME back through IMAP APPEND.

  ### 5. Clean up artifacts

  - After a successful release or discard, delete staged/original attachment files from disk.

  ### 6. Guardrails & security

  - Enforce file size limits and MIME lists for uploads.
  - Validate filenames to avoid path traversal issues.
  - Provide clear warnings when releasing without an attachment (if that’s critical).

  ### 7. Tests & docs

  - Unit tests for parsing attachments and reconstructing MIME messages.
  - Integration test: intercept an email with a PDF, remove/replace it through the UI, release it, ensure the IMAP message matches expectations.

  When you’re ready, we can build this in stages (storage → UI → release rebuild → cleanup) so we can ship incremental improvements without breaking the current flow.
