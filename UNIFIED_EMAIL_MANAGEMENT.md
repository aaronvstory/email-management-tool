# Unified Email Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Consolidated three separate email management views (Inbox, Queue, and Held) into a single, unified interface with improved functionality and consistent design.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Unified Template
**File:** `templates/emails_unified.html`

**Features:**
- Single page with tab-based filtering (All, Held, Pending, Approved, Rejected)
- Account selector with fetch controls
- Unified email table with consistent actions
- Working edit modal with save and release functionality
- Auto-refresh capability (user-controlled)
- Search and filter functionality
- Bulk actions support

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Fixed edit functionality - modal now loads and saves correctly
- ✅ Consistent dark theme styling throughout
- ✅ Proper status badges (rectangular, not pills)
- ✅ Responsive design with proper spacing
- ✅ Smart action buttons based on email status

### 2. Backend Routes
**File:** `app/routes/emails.py`

**New Routes:**
- `/emails-unified` - Main unified interface
- `/api/emails/unified` - API endpoint for email list with counts
- `/emails-legacy` - Legacy queue view (kept for compatibility)

**Modified Routes:**
- `/emails` - Now redirects to unified view
- `/inbox` - Redirects to unified view (via inbox.py)
- `/interception` - Redirects to unified view (via interception.py)

### 3. Navigation Updates
**File:** `templates/base.html`

**Changes:**
- Top navigation now shows "Emails" instead of separate "Inbox" and "Held" links
- Sidebar navigation updated to point to unified view
- Active state detection works across all email-related routes

### 4. Route Redirects
**Files:** `app/routes/inbox.py`, `app/routes/interception.py`

**Changes:**
- Legacy routes now redirect to unified view with appropriate filters
- Original implementations preserved as `-legacy` routes for reference

## How It Works

### Status Filtering
The unified view uses a tab-based system:
- **All**: Shows all emails regardless of status
- **Held**: Shows emails with `interception_status='HELD'`
- **Pending**: Shows emails with `status='PENDING'`
- **Approved**: Shows emails with `status='APPROVED'`
- **Rejected**: Shows emails with `status='REJECTED'`

### Action Buttons
Actions are dynamically shown based on email status:

**For HELD emails:**
- Edit (opens modal)
- Release (sends to inbox)
- Discard (permanently removes)

**For PENDING emails:**
- Edit (opens modal)
- Approve (marks as approved)
- Reject (marks as rejected)

**For other statuses:**
- View (opens detail page)

### Edit Functionality
The edit modal now works correctly:
1. Fetches email data from `/email/<id>/edit` endpoint
2. Populates modal fields with current values
3. Saves changes via `/api/email/<id>/edit` POST endpoint
4. Option to "Save & Release" for held emails

### Auto-Refresh
- User can enable/disable auto-refresh via checkbox
- Refreshes every 30 seconds when enabled
- Preference saved in localStorage
- Only refreshes when page is visible (respects document.hidden)

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/emails/unified`
Returns list of emails with counts.

**Query Parameters:**
- `status` - Filter by status (ALL, HELD, PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED)
- `account_id` - Filter by account ID

**Response:**
```json
{
  "emails": [...],
  "counts": {
    "total": 100,
    "held": 5,
    "pending": 10,
    "approved": 50,
    "rejected": 35
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/email/<id>/edit`
Saves email edits.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "subject": "Updated subject",
  "body_text": "Updated body"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "updated_fields": ["subject", "body_text"],
  "verified": {...}
}
```

## Migration Guide

### For Users
1. Navigate to any email view (Inbox, Queue, or Held)
2. You'll be automatically redirected to the unified view
3. Use tabs to filter by status
4. All functionality remains the same, just in one place

### For Developers
- Old routes still work (they redirect)
- Legacy templates preserved for reference
- API endpoints unchanged
- Database schema unchanged

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Edit modal opens correctly
- [x] Edit saves successfully
