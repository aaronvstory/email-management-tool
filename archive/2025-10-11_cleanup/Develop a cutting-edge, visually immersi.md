Develop a cutting-edge, visually immersive, and feature-rich 3D Flappy Bird game using Three.js, adhering to modern web development best practices and delivering a polished user experience.

**Core Game Mechanics:**

*   **Advanced Bird Physics:** Implement realistic, physically-based bird movement governed by gravity, responsive flapping mechanics with fluid animations (including wing deformation), and precise collision detection using bounding volumes or raycasting.
*   **Procedural Pipe Generation:** Design a robust pipe system that dynamically generates pipes with randomized heights, consistent and adjustable gaps, and subtle variations in appearance to avoid monotony. Implement a recycling mechanism for pipes that have moved off-screen.
*   **Persistent Scoring System:** Display a real-time score counter with animated transitions. Persist the high score using `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`, incorporating visual feedback when a new high score is achieved.
*   **Comprehensive Game State Management:** Implement distinct game states (Start Screen, Gameplay, Game Over, Pause) with smooth transitions and appropriate UI elements for each state. Include a clear restart mechanism.

**Visual Design & 3D Elements:**

*   **High-Fidelity 3D Bird Model:** Create or source a detailed, optimized 3D bird model with realistic textures, materials (PBR preferred), and dynamic wing flapping animations driven by skeletal animation or vertex shaders. Consider adding subtle idle animations.
*   **Immersive Environmental Design:**
    *   **Multi-Layered Parallax Background:** Implement a parallax scrolling background with multiple layers of 3D elements (mountains, clouds, trees) moving at different speeds to create a sense of depth and scale.
    *   **Detailed 3D Pipe Models:** Design realistic 3D pipe models with varied textures, materials (including specular highlights and normal maps), and subtle imperfections to enhance realism. Consider adding animated elements like dripping water or steam.
    *   **Dynamic Sky System:** Create a dynamic skybox or sky dome with gradient colors that smoothly transition based on the game's progress (time of day, score milestones). Implement procedural cloud generation for added realism.
    *   **Advanced Particle Effects:** Implement visually appealing particle effects for various interactions, including a customizable bird trail, impactful collision effects (debris, sparks), and scoring animations. Utilize shaders for optimized particle rendering.
*   **Sophisticated Lighting:** Implement a combination of ambient, directional, and point lights to create depth, shadows, and highlights. Explore techniques like shadow mapping or screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) for enhanced realism.
*   **Dynamic Camera System:** Implement a smooth, responsive camera that follows the bird with subtle lead and lag. Add camera shake effects on collisions and dynamic field-of-view adjustments for dramatic moments.

**Advanced Features:**

*   **Unlockable Bird Characters:** Implement a system for unlocking multiple bird characters with unique appearances, animations, and potentially slightly different physics characteristics.
*   **Strategic Power-Ups:** Introduce power-ups with temporary effects, such as invincibility (visual shield), slow motion (time dilation), score multipliers, or temporary gap widening. Implement clear visual and audio cues for power-up activation and duration.
*   **Adaptive Difficulty Scaling:** Implement a dynamic difficulty system that gradually increases pipe speed, frequency, and gap variations based on the player's score or time played. Consider introducing new environmental hazards or obstacles.
*   **Immersive Sound Design:** Integrate 3D positional audio using the Web Audio API for flapping, scoring, collisions, and environmental sounds. Implement dynamic audio mixing and effects to enhance the sense of immersion.
*   **Cross-Platform Responsiveness:** Ensure seamless gameplay across various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones) with touch controls for mobile devices and mouse/keyboard support for desktop. Implement responsive UI scaling and adaptive graphics settings.

**Technical Implementation:**

*   **Modular and Maintainable Codebase:**
    *   **ES6+ JavaScript with Classes:** Utilize modern JavaScript features and object-oriented programming principles for a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
    *   **Separation of Concerns:** Organize code into separate modules for game logic, rendering, physics, UI, and audio management.
    *   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provide clear, concise, and comprehensive comments throughout the code, explaining the purpose of each function, class, and variable. Implement robust error handling and logging.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Object Pooling:** Implement object pooling for pipes, particles, and other frequently created and destroyed objects to minimize garbage collection and improve performance.
    *   **Efficient Geometry and Material Reuse:** Optimize geometry and material usage by sharing resources whenever possible. Utilize techniques like instancing for rendering multiple identical objects efficiently.
    *   **Profiling and Optimization:** Regularly profile the game's performance and identify bottlenecks. Optimize critical sections of code using techniques like memoization or WebAssembly (if necessary). Target a consistent 60fps performance across a range of devices.
*   **Modern Web APIs:**
    *   **Web Audio API:** Utilize the Web Audio API for advanced audio processing and spatialization.
    *   **RequestAnimationFrame:** Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth and efficient animation updates.
    *   **CSS3 for UI:** Leverage CSS3 for styling UI elements and creating smooth transitions.
    *   **Consider WebGL2:** If appropriate, utilize WebGL2 features for enhanced rendering capabilities and performance.

**User Interface:**

*   **Intuitive HUD:** Design a clear and informative HUD that displays the score, high score, power-up status, and other relevant information.
*   **Engaging Menus:** Create stylish and user-friendly start screen, game over screen, and pause menu with clear navigation and interactive elements.
*   **Customizable Settings Panel:** Implement a settings panel that allows users to adjust volume levels, graphics quality (resolution, particle density, shadow quality), and control schemes.
*   **Adaptive Layout:** Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
