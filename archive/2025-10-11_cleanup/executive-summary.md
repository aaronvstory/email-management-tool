# Executive Summary

## Overview

Email Management Tool is a production‑ready Python Flask application for secure, local email interception, moderation, and management. It lets organizations and power users review, edit, and control inbound email before delivery, adding a strong security and compliance layer for sensitive environments. It runs entirely on Windows with SQLite, with no cloud dependencies and no Docker required.

## Core Purpose

* Intercept inbound email via an SMTP proxy and IMAP monitoring
* Hold suspicious or policy‑violating messages for review
* Edit, release, or discard held messages with full audit logging
* Manage multiple accounts including Gmail, Hostinger, Outlook, Yahoo, and generic IMAP and SMTP
* Provide a secure, modern dashboard for moderation and account management

## Key Features and Methods

Interception Pipeline

The tool intercepts, moderates, and controls inbound email using standard user credentials such as a password or an app password. It does not require administrative privileges.

SMTP Proxy

* Local proxy runs on a configurable port on the machine
* Accounts can route incoming mail to the proxy using forwarding or routing rules
* The proxy accepts messages, parses and stores them, and places them in a moderation queue
* The process is transparent to recipients

IMAP Monitoring

* Uses IMAPClient to connect with provided credentials
* Leverages IMAP IDLE to detect new messages in near real time
* New messages are moved to a quarantine folder using standard IMAP operations

Moderation and Release

* Review held messages in the dashboard
* Approvers can edit, release to the inbox, or discard
* Released messages are appended to the inbox while preserving timestamps and metadata

Audit Logging and Security

* Every intercept, edit, release, and discard action is logged in SQLite
* Stored credentials are encrypted
* Rate limiting and CSRF protection enforced at the application layer

## How It Works

* SMTP proxy receives messages first, then stores them for moderation
* IMAP monitor detects new items and moves them into quarantine
* Reviewers edit, release, or discard; released items are appended to the target inbox with original dates

## Design Rationale and Practices

* Modular design with Flask blueprints and clear service boundaries
* CSRF protection, rate limiting, and bcrypt for password hashing
* Symmetric encryption with Fernet for stored secrets
* pytest based tests for interception, security, and functional flows
* Resilient error handling around SMTP and IMAP failures and connectivity issues
* For larger deployments, consider PostgreSQL or another scalable database
* Focused UX with consistent styling and non‑blocking notifications

## Security and Compliance

* Full audit trail for compliance and investigation
* Principle of least privilege using standard user credentials
* Local only operation, suitable for sensitive environments

## User Experience

* Responsive dashboard for desktop, tablet, and mobile
* Non‑blocking notifications via toasts
* Clear inputs and cards for readability and accessibility

## Supported Providers

* Gmail using an app password with STARTTLS or SSL and IMAP
* Hostinger with direct SSL and IMAP
* Outlook and Yahoo with app passwords and IMAP
* Generic providers that support IMAP and SMTP with smart detection

## Deployment and Operations

* Runs locally on Windows with no external dependencies
* Automated security setup with PowerShell
* Account management through the dashboard or scripts
* Comprehensive test suite for interception, statistics, and security

## Why This Tool

* Prevents data leaks and policy violations before delivery
* Centralizes email moderation across many accounts
* Maintains full control and auditability for inbound communications
* Works securely in sensitive environments without cloud exposure

## Decision Requests

* Confirm target deployment size and data retention period
* Approve initial policy scope and reviewer roles
* Validate roadmap priorities for the next quarter

## Next Steps

* Pilot with a small group and measure the success metrics below
* Finalize policy templates and onboarding guides
* Prepare security review and operating procedures

## Success Metrics

* Fewer policy violations reaching inboxes
* Time from intercept to reviewer decision
* Reviewer throughput and accuracy
* Mean time to configure a new account
