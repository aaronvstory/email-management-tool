- `app/routes/emails.py` - Safe UID SEARCH and payload decoding
- `app/routes/interception.py` - Proper IMAP APPEND with Time2Internaldate
- `simple_app.py` - Safe Flask-WTF CSRF import
- `templates/base.html` - Standard background-clip CSS

### ‚úÖ System Health Verified
- **Application**: Running on http://localhost:5000 ‚úÖ
- **Database**: Integrity OK, 52 emails stored ‚úÖ
- **SMTP Proxy**: Port 8587 operational ‚úÖ
- **Security**: CSRF enabled, strong SECRET_KEY configured ‚úÖ
- **All Python files**: Compile without errors ‚úÖ
- **All imports**: Work correctly ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Test Scripts Recreated
Lost test scripts have been recreated:
1. `test_flow_final.py` - Core flow validation
2. `test_api_release.py` - Complete end-to-end with delivery

### ‚úÖ Git Cleanup
- Added temporary files to `.gitignore`
- WAL/SHM files excluded from tracking
- Windows 'nul' device file handled

## Current System Status

```json
{
  "health": "ok",
  "database": "ok",
  "held_emails": 31,
  "security": {
    "csrf_enabled": true,
    "secret_key_configured": true
  }
}
```

## Testing the Recovery

### Quick Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/healthz
```

### Run Core Tests
```bash
# Test basic flow
python test_flow_final.py

# Test complete end-to-end
python test_api_release.py
```

### Check Database
```bash
python -c "import sqlite3; conn = sqlite3.connect('email_manager.db');
          cur = conn.cursor();
          print('Tables:', cur.execute(\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\").fetchall());
          print('Emails:', cur.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email_messages').fetchone()[0])"
```

## What Was Lost

The following files were lost in the corruption but have been handled:
- ‚ùå Test documentation (INTERCEPTION_FLOW_TEST_RESULTS.md, etc.) - Can be regenerated if needed
- ‚ùå Some test outputs - Not critical

## Recovery Actions Completed

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Assess corruption damage | ‚úÖ | All files scanned |
| Verify critical files | ‚úÖ | All compile successfully |
| Check database integrity | ‚úÖ | Database intact, 52 emails |
| Test application startup | ‚úÖ | Running on port 5000 |
| Fix syntax/import errors | ‚úÖ | No errors found |
| Clean up temporary files | ‚úÖ | Added to .gitignore |
| Recreate test scripts | ‚úÖ | 2 scripts recreated |

## Next Steps

The system is fully operational. You can:

1. **Run tests** to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   python test_flow_final.py
   python test_api_release.py
   ```

2. **Continue development** - all core systems working

3. **Access the dashboard** at http://localhost:5000
   - Login: admin / admin123
