# Interception Tests Complete - October 1, 2025

## Summary

Comprehensive interception lifecycle tests have been implemented and are fully passing. All three critical patches have been applied:

1. ✅ **INTERNALDATE Extraction** - Already implemented in `simple_app.py`
2. ✅ **Released Count Aggregation** - Added to `app/utils/db.py::fetch_counts()`
3. ✅ **Comprehensive Tests** - New test suite in `tests/test_intercept_flow.py`

## Changes Applied

### 1. INTERNALDATE Extraction (Already Implemented)

**Location**: `simple_app.py:1082-1107`

The `/api/fetch-emails` endpoint already had proper INTERNALDATE parsing:
- Extracts INTERNALDATE from IMAP server response
- Uses `imaplib.Internaldate2tuple()` for reliable parsing
- Falls back to Date header if INTERNALDATE unavailable
- Stores as ISO format in `original_internaldate` column

### 2. Released Count Aggregation

**Location**: `app/utils/db.py:66-92`

Added `released` count to `fetch_counts()` function:
- Counts emails with `interception_status='RELEASED'`
- Also includes legacy statuses: `SENT`, `APPROVED`, `DELIVERED`
- Supports both account-scoped and global queries
- Uses single database connection for efficiency

**Change**:
```python
legacy_released_clause = "(interception_status='RELEASED' OR status IN ('SENT','APPROVED','DELIVERED'))"

# Account-scoped
counts['released'] = cur.execute(
    f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email_messages WHERE {legacy_released_clause} AND account_id=?",
    (account_id,)
).fetchone()[0]

# Global
counts['released'] = cur.execute(
    f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email_messages WHERE {legacy_released_clause}"
).fetchone()[0]
```

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite

**Location**: `tests/test_intercept_flow.py`

New test file with 3 passing tests covering complete lifecycle:

#### Test 1: `test_fetch_stores_uid_and_internaldate`
- Mocks IMAP connection with fake UID and INTERNALDATE
- Calls `/api/fetch-emails` endpoint
- Verifies `original_uid` and `original_internaldate` are stored
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING

#### Test 2: `test_manual_intercept_moves_and_latency`
- Seeds test database with FETCHED email
- Mocks IMAP connection and remote MOVE operation
- Calls `/api/email/<id>/intercept` endpoint
- Verifies:
  - `interception_status='HELD'`
  - `latency_ms` is calculated correctly
  - Remote MOVE succeeded
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING

#### Test 3: `test_release_sets_delivered`
- Seeds test database with HELD email
- Mocks IMAP APPEND operation for release
- Calls `/api/interception/release/<id>` endpoint
- Verifies:
  - `interception_status='RELEASED'`
  - `status='DELIVERED'`
  - `edited_message_id` is set
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING

## Test Execution

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_intercept_flow.py -v
```

**Results**:
```
tests/test_intercept_flow.py::test_fetch_stores_uid_and_internaldate PASSED [ 33%]
tests/test_intercept_flow.py::test_manual_intercept_moves_and_latency PASSED [ 66%]
tests/test_intercept_flow.py::test_release_sets_delivered PASSED         [100%]

======================== 3 passed, 2 warnings in 0.53s ========================
```

## Key Features

### IMAP Mocking with `FakeIMAP`
- Simulates IMAP server responses
- Returns properly formatted INTERNALDATE strings
- Supports UID SEARCH, FETCH, MOVE, COPY, STORE operations
- No external dependencies required

### Test Isolation
- Uses `TEST_DB_PATH` environment variable
- Creates fresh database for each test run
- Module-scoped fixture for database lifecycle
- Automatic cleanup after tests complete

### Authentication Bypass
- Uses `monkeypatch` to bypass Flask-Login
- Simulates authenticated user with admin role
- No need for actual login during tests

### Comprehensive Coverage
Complete email lifecycle tested:
```
FETCHED → Manual Intercept → HELD → Release → RELEASED/DELIVERED
```

## Dashboard Integration

The `released` count is now available in `fetch_counts()` and can be displayed in the dashboard:

```python
from app.utils.db import fetch_counts

counts = fetch_counts(account_id=2)
# counts = {
#     'total': 150,
#     'pending': 5,
#     'approved': 0,
#     'rejected': 2,
#     'sent': 100,
#     'held': 10,
#     'released': 120  # NEW!
# }
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Index Optimization**: Add index on `(interception_status, direction)` for faster filtering
2. **Original UID Index**: Add index on `original_uid` for IMAP lookups
3. **Folder Naming**: Unify quarantine folder naming (currently 'Quarantine')
4. **Dashboard Display**: Update dashboard to show `released` count

## Migration Commands

No migration needed - all changes are backwards compatible:
- INTERNALDATE extraction was already present
- `released` count uses existing columns
- Tests are self-contained and isolated

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/utils/db.py` - Added `released` count to `fetch_counts()`
2. ✅ `tests/test_intercept_flow.py` - New comprehensive test suite
3. ✅ `simple_app.py` - No changes (INTERNALDATE already implemented)

## Verification

To verify all changes are working:

```bash
# Run interception tests
python -m pytest tests/test_intercept_flow.py -v

# Verify released count in Python shell
python -c "from app.utils.db import fetch_counts; print(fetch_counts())"

# Check INTERNALDATE storage (if emails exist)
python -c "import sqlite3; conn=sqlite3.connect('email_manager.db'); print(conn.execute('SELECT original_uid, original_internaldate FROM email_messages WHERE original_internaldate IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1').fetchone())"
```
