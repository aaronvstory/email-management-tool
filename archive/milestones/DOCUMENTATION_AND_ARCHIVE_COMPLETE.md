## Active Documentation Files (Retained in Root)

### Critical Files (Must Stay)
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Main project documentation (ENHANCED)
- ✅ `STYLEGUIDE.md` - UI/UX standards (mandatory reference)
- ✅ `PERMANENT_TEST_ACCOUNTS.md` - Account configuration guide
- ✅ `INTERCEPTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical architecture details

### Why These Stay
These files are **actively referenced** in current development:
- CLAUDE.md: Primary guidance for all development work
- STYLEGUIDE.md: UI consistency enforcement (all UI changes reference this)
- PERMANENT_TEST_ACCOUNTS.md: Active test account credentials
- INTERCEPTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md: Current architecture reference

---

## Manual Review Items

### emails.db Decision Required
**Status**: Found in root directory (size check needed)
**Question**: Is this active or deprecated?
- If **active**: Keep in root
- If **legacy**: Move to `archive/databases/` with README
- If **duplicate**: Compare with `email_manager.db` and remove

**Action**: Developer must verify database usage before archiving

---

## Archive Notice System

Created `archive/README.md` with:
- **Timestamp**: 2025-10-01 05:22:10
- **Reason**: Project cleanup for maintainability
- **Contents Index**: Lists all archived categories
- **Usage Guidelines**: Read-only reference policy
- **References**: Links to current documentation

---

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Cleaner Root Directory
- **Before**: 29 files in root (including 10+ completion markers)
- **After**: 13 core files + organized archive
- **Reduction**: ~55% fewer root-level files

### 2. Improved Documentation
- **At-a-Glance**: Instant access to critical info (ports, credentials, launchers)
- **Prerequisites**: Clear setup requirements
- **Security Notes**: Explicit test account warnings
- **Condensed Guidance**: Removed ~15 lines of redundancy

### 3. Historical Preservation
- All milestone documentation preserved in structured archive
- Original timestamps and file sizes maintained
- Clear categorization by file type and purpose
- Reference links to current active documentation

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Faster Onboarding**: At-a-Glance table provides instant orientation
- **Clear Organization**: Easy to distinguish active vs historical files
- **Maintained Context**: Archive preserves full development history
- **Better Navigation**: Updated File Organization section shows complete structure

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

### Phase 0: Database Hardening (Recommended Next)
As outlined in prior analysis:
1. Add `interception_status` index to `email_messages` table
2. Implement batch read optimization
3. Add connection pooling for high-load scenarios
4. Create database migration script with rollback support

### Phase 1+: Refactoring Phases
Continue with planned refactor phases (see prior analysis document)

### Documentation Maintenance
- Keep CLAUDE.md updated with new features
- Move new completion markers to archive/milestones/ periodically
- Update archive/README.md index as needed
