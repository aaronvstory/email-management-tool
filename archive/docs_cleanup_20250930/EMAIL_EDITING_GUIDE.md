# Email Editing Functionality Guide

## Overview

The Email Management Tool provides comprehensive email editing capabilities for pending emails. Users can modify both the subject and body of emails before they are approved and sent.

## Features

- ✅ **Full Subject Editing**: Complete modification of email subjects
- ✅ **Full Body Editing**: Complete rewriting of email content
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: All edits are logged with username and timestamp
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators and success messages
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if issues occur
- ✅ **Modal Interface**: Clean, non-disruptive editing experience

## How to Edit Emails

### Step 1: Access the Email Queue

1. Login to the application at http://localhost:5000
2. Navigate to the **Emails** tab in the dashboard
3. Emails with "PENDING" status can be edited

### Step 2: Open the Edit Modal

1. Find the email you want to edit in the table
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) in the Actions column
3. The edit modal will open with the current email content

### Step 3: Make Your Changes

1. **Subject Field**: Modify the subject line as needed
2. **Body Field**: Rewrite or edit the email content
3. Both fields are required and cannot be empty

### Step 4: Save Changes

1. Click the **Save Changes** button
2. You'll see a "Saving..." indicator while the changes are processed
3. Upon success, you'll see "Saved!" briefly
4. The page will reload showing your updated email

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Endpoint

- **Route**: `/email/<int:email_id>/edit`
- **Methods**: GET (fetch details), POST (save changes)
- **Authentication**: Login required
- **Validation**: Only PENDING emails can be edited

### Frontend JavaScript

```javascript
// Fetch email details
GET /email/{id}/edit
Response: {
  "id": 123,
  "subject": "Current Subject",
  "body": "Current body text",
  "sender": "sender@email.com",
  "recipients": "recipient@email.com"
}

// Save changes
POST /email/{id}/edit
Body: {
  "subject": "New Subject",
  "body": "New body text"
}
Response: {
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email updated successfully"
}
```

### Database Updates

- Email subject and body are updated
- Review notes are appended with edit information
- Format: `[Edited by {username} at {timestamp}]`

## Testing

### Automated Testing

Two test scripts are provided:

1. **Backend Test** (`test_email_edit.py`)

   - Tests API endpoints directly
   - Verifies database updates
   - Checks audit trail creation

2. **UI Test** (`test_email_edit_ui.js`)
   - Uses Puppeteer for browser automation
   - Tests complete user workflow
   - Takes screenshots at each step

### Manual Testing

1. Run `python create_test_email.py` to create sample emails
2. Follow the editing steps above
3. Verify changes in the database

## Security Considerations

- Only authenticated users can edit emails
- Only PENDING status emails are editable
- All edits are logged with user information
- Input validation prevents empty submissions

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load email details"

- Check if the email ID exists
- Verify the email status is PENDING
- Check browser console for detailed errors

### Modal doesn't open

- Ensure Bootstrap JavaScript is loaded
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Verify the modal HTML is present in the page

### Changes not saving

- Verify both subject and body have content
- Check network tab for API response
- Ensure you're logged in

## Recent Improvements (September 2025)

- Enhanced error handling with detailed messages
- Added visual feedback during save operations
- Improved response status checking
- Added debugging console logs
- Fixed Bootstrap modal initialization issues

## API Response Formats

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email updated successfully"
}
```

### Error Responses

```json
{
  "error": "Email not found"
}
```

```json

}
```
