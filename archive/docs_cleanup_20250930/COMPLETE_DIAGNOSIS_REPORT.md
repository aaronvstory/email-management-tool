‚úÖ HTTPS (Port 443): Working
‚úÖ HTTP (Port 80): Working
‚úÖ IMAP (Port 993): Working
‚ùå SMTP (Ports 25/465/587): ALL BLOCKED
```

## üéØ THE REAL PROBLEM

### It's NOT:

- ‚ùå Windows Firewall (rules added, outbound allowed)
- ‚ùå Credential issues (passwords are correct)
- ‚ùå Port configuration (settings are correct)
- ‚ùå DNS problems (resolution works)
- ‚ùå Internet connectivity (HTTPS works fine)

### It IS:

- ‚úÖ **ExpressVPN is blocking ALL SMTP traffic**
- ‚úÖ This is a common VPN security feature
- ‚úÖ Many VPNs block SMTP to prevent spam

## üìù CURRENT WORKAROUND IMPLEMENTED

The application now:

1. **Detects SMTP blocks** before attempting to send
2. **Queues emails** with status "QUEUED" when blocked
3. **Provides clear feedback** about VPN blocking
4. **Enables retry** via `retry_queued_emails.py`

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION STEPS COMPLETED

1. ‚úÖ Checked Windows Firewall - NOT the issue
2. ‚úÖ Added firewall rules - Still blocked
3. ‚úÖ Tested all SMTP ports - ALL blocked by VPN
4. ‚úÖ Verified credentials - Passwords are CORRECT
5. ‚úÖ Confirmed VPN is cause - ExpressVPN blocking SMTP

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED ACTION

**IMMEDIATE:** Disconnect ExpressVPN temporarily to send emails
**LONG-TERM:** Configure split tunneling or switch to SMTP-friendly VPN
